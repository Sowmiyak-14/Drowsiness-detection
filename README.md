The phenomenon of driver drowsiness constitutes a critical determinant in the incidence of road traffic accidents, resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities on a global scale. The real-time detection of driver fatigue is imperative for enhancing road safety measures. This project is dedicated to the development of a Driver Drowsiness Detection System utilizing OpenCV and Keras, aimed at monitoring the facial features and behavioral patterns of drivers, thereby issuing alerts upon the recognition of drowsiness indicators. OpenCV is utilized for the acquisition and analysis of real-time video data to perform facial landmark detection, with a particular focus on monitoring ocular and cranial movements, which serve as pivotal indicators of drowsiness. A deep learning model, constructed with Keras, is trained to categorize diverse states of drowsiness predicated on the observed features. The system evaluates parameters such as the rate of eye blinks, the frequency of yawning, and head nodding, which are frequently correlated with fatigue. Should the system identify sustained eye closures or other manifestations of drowsiness, it initiates an alert to notify the driver. The objective of this project is to augment driver safety by establishing a timely warning mechanism, thereby mitigating the risk of accidents attributable to driver fatigue. This methodology exemplifies the efficacy of integrating computer vision and machine learning technologies to tackle pressing real-world challenges, thus contributing to the advancement of intelligent, safety-centric vehicular technologies.
